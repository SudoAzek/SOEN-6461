INTRODUCTION

A machine called a Ticket Vending Machine (TVM), also referred to as a ticket machine or ticketing kiosk, is a vending machine that is automated and self-service. It produces tickets for various forms of public transportation. While TVMs can be used for other purposes, this text focuses solely on their application in public transportation.

The objective of the project is to develop a collection of interconnected components for the software aspect of a TVM that is maintainable, secure, environmentally sustainable, and user-friendly. Throughout the document, the term "iGo" is used to refer to both the project and the product, unless otherwise specified.
